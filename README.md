# mothers-in-bangladesh
This is my final project for the course 'Data Analysis in Practice'. I had a pleasure of taking this course during my exchange at Kyoto University. The purpose of the work was to identify the risk factors responsible for maternal mortality in Bangladesh's rural areas. The full report and code of the project can be found in this repository.
